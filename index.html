        <h1 id="info-header">The passion for Italian food craftsmanship</h1>
        <p id="info">
            The concept was founded in Germany in 2002 and in autumn 2007 Vapiano was established in Sweden. We are therefore not a restaurant with Italian roots, with us you will rather find a happy mixture of nationalities and backgrounds.
        </p>
        <h3 class="info-mini-header">Our uncompromising mission</h3>
        <p class="info-paragraph">
            What unites us is a genuine common denominator; our uncompromising mission to make our passion for Italian food craftsmanship and effortless socializing available to everyone! (On our menu you will therefore find our interpretations of Italian cuisine. Among our pasta, pizza, risotto and salads there are both dairy-free and gluten-free and vegan options.
        </p>
        <h3 class="info-mini-header">Who goes Slow and steady wins</h3>
        <p class="info-paragraph">
            Our name, Vapiano, refers to precisely this undemandingness. "Chi va piano va sano e va lontano" is a popular Italian saying. It is most easily translated "People who take it easy, live a long and healthy life". Take that 'vapiano', come as you are and let your preferences rule. We don't compromise on the quality of our food, but when it comes to where, how, what or when to eat - the choice is entirely yours. Share a pizza among four, go all in on your own three-course meal, enjoy a smooth cup of coffee or eat your fill of dolci. There are no requirements or rules for how your restaurant visit should look like.
