      <h1 id="info-header">The passion for Italian food craftsmanship</h1>
      <p id="info">
        The concept was founded in Germany in 2002 and in autumn 2007 Vapiano
        was established in Sweden. We are therefore not a restaurant with
        Italian roots, with us you will rather find a happy mixture of
        nationalities and backgrounds.
      </p>
      <h3 class="info-mini-header">Our uncompromising mission</h3>
      <p class="info-paragraph">
        What unites us is a genuine common denominator; our uncompromising
        mission to make our passion for Italian food craftsmanship and
        effortless socializing available to everyone! (On our menu you will
        therefore find our interpretations of Italian cuisine. Among our pasta,
        pizza, risotto and salads there are both dairy-free and gluten-free and
        vegan options.
      </p>
      <h3 class="info-mini-header">Who goes Slow and steady wins</h3>
      <p class="info-paragraph">
        Our name, Vapiano, refers to precisely this undemandingness. "Chi va
        piano va sano e va lontano" is a popular Italian saying. It is most
        easily translated "People who take it easy, live a long and healthy
        life". Take that 'vapiano', come as you are and let your preferences
        rule. We don't compromise on the quality of our food, but when it comes
        to where, how, what or when to eat - the choice is entirely yours. Share
        a pizza among four, go all in on your own three-course meal, enjoy a
        smooth cup of coffee or eat your fill of dolci. There are no
        requirements or rules for how your restaurant visit should look like.
